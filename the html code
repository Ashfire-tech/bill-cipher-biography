  <p id="tribute-info">Bill Cipher was one of the most twisted dream demons in the history of the universe.His original home was the second dimesion which he despised.He described it as "flat minds in a flat world with flat dreams."He "liberated" it by plunging it into burning chaos, killing everyone he'd ever known including <strong>his own parents</strong>.<br> He eventually took over a boiling, shifting intergalactic foam between dimensions: a lawless, unstable crawlspace known as the Nightmare Realm but due to the lawlessness and lack of consitent rules and physics it would eventually collapse into itself. Bill knew this and decided to merge the nightmare realm and the third dimension.

<br>
Without a physical form, however, Bill could only access the dreams of the third dimension's beings(humans) In order to make his dealings with mortals easier, he took on the name "Bill Cipher" as his real name would "evaporate one with an expression of horror and ecstasy on their face." Among his targets were the natives who lived in what would become the town of Gravity Falls, Oregon.
<br>
The natives eventually discovered a way to defeat Bill by using a zodiac with ten symbols(after learning how dangerous he was). They left behind cave paintings about their encounter with the demon, how to summon him, and a warning to never summon him. The valley was deemed a "cursed land" by the natives, who evacuated around 1000 AD. The area would eventually be rediscovered by Quentin Trembley and repopulated by pioneers, giving rise to the town of Gravity Falls.
<br>
<br>
In the late twentieth century, a young man named Stanford Pines, who had spent the past six years investigating the town's plethora of unnatural creatures and oddities, hit a roadblock in his research and was left without answers as to how the improbabilities of Gravity Falls had come to be. During the roadblock, he uncovered the ancient cave containing the ancients' stories of Bill Cipher. Heedless of the warnings, Ford repeated the incantation aloud, summoning Bill into his mind. Bill recognized Ford's brilliant but cocky and insecure nature, and his near-friendlessness as ideal conditions for manipulation, choosing to introduce himself to Ford as a muse who chose one brilliant mind every century to inspire.
<br>
It was Bill who revealed to Ford that Gravity Falls' weirdness was caused by a rift between dimensions, through which the other side's weirdness leaked through. With Bill's assistance, Stanford drafted blueprints to create an inter-dimensional gateway beneath his home and recruited his college friend Fiddleford McGucket for assistance. As Bill and Ford's partnership grew to friendship, Ford seemed to develop an obsession with Bill's powers, modeling his home's architecture in his image, converting his private study into a place of worship. He even allowed the demon to enter his mind; this, along with the amount of information he seemed to simply produce on the spot, made Fiddleford increasingly uneasy of the portal and of Ford's mysterious collaborator, as Ford never mentioned Bill's identity to his partner.
<br>
<br>
On January 18, 1982, Ford and Fiddleford performed their first trial with the active portal. This went wrong and caused Fiddleford to see Bill Cipher removing his exoskeleton through the portal. After this incident he abandoned the project and told Stanford that he should do the same.
<br>
The suspicion planted in him by Fiddleford led to a confrontation between Ford and Bill, during which Ford learned that Bill had tricked him, as the portal was meant to act as a gateway to the Nightmare Realm, allowing the demon to bring chaos and destruction into their universe. Horrified and betrayed, Ford shut down the project and attempted to destroy all knowledge of the portal, before accidentally falling through it himself. Bill either could not see Ford in the thirty years he spent lost in other dimensions or didn't care to, as Ford would remark that they had not seen each other in many years. With the loss of his human pawn, Bill also lost physical access to the third dimension.A few years after this, he met the Pine twins and by tricking one of them, Mabel Pines, finally managed to have a physical form in the third dimesion and merge part of the third dimesion with the Nightmare realm. He was, however, soon defeated and turned into a statue.<br>
